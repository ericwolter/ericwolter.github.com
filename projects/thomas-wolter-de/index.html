The site was launched in 2000. The goal was to built the definitive resource for Rubik's Snake on the internet.</p>
<p>The highlight of the website, which followed later was a 3D-Viewer for the different figures the snake could be rotated into. Unfortunately this viewer used a combination of old technologies which slowly started to be incompatible and broken in modern browers.</p>
<p>This provided the perfect opportunity for me to complete redesign and reimplement the website in 2013. I completely revamped both the overall look and feel and the 3D-Viewer using modern techologies.</p>
<p>The new 3D-Viewer just requires the text notation of the figure as an input. The result can be freely rotated and looked at by the user. This is achieved using the excellent <a href="http://threejs.org/">three.js</a> framework and its HTML canvas renderer.</p>
