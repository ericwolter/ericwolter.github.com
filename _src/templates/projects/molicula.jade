        ### Description
        Molicula is a fascinatingly simple puzzle game. Rotate and flip the pieces to fill the grid. Only 6 out of the 7 pieces are required to complete the grid. Which piece you leave out determines the difficulty of finding a solution.

        Can you find all solutions?

        * Simple graphics
        * Intuitive gestures
        * Over 40 unique solutions

        Note: This is a digital adaptation of the physical puzzle "Fantastic Island" (sometimes called "Atompuzzle").

        * Universal iPhone support
        * New animations
