      :markdown
        This is the code and document for my bachelor's thesis. It includes my own rough implementation of "Solid Simulation with Oriented Particles" by Matthias MÃ¼ller and Nuttapong Chentanez. I developed a simple method to couple their oriented particles with a rigid body simulation built on top of the bullet physics library.
