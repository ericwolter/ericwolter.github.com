    h3 Description

    p 
      | This is the personal website by Thomas Wolter (
      a(href='http://thomas-wolter.de/new') thomas-wolter.de
      | ).
      | The site was launched in 2000. The goal was to built the definitive resource for Rubik's Snake on the internet.
    p The highlight of the website, which followed later was a 3D-Viewer for the different figures the snake could be rotated into. Unfortunately this viewer used a combination of old technologies which slowly started to be incompatible and broken in modern browers.
    p This provided the perfect opportunity for me to complete redesign and reimplement the website in 2013. I completely revamped both the overall look and feel and the 3D-Viewer using modern techologies.
    p 
      | The new 3D-Viewer just requires the text notation of the figure as an input. 
      | The result can be freely rotated and looked at by the user. 
      | This is achieved using the excellent 
      a(href='http://threejs.org/') three.js
      |  framework and its canvas renderer.
